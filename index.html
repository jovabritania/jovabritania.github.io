    <h1>DIY Natural Face Mask</h1>
    <h2>Oat Face Mask</h2>
    <p>You will need 1/2 avocado, 1 tablespoon of honey, and handful of oats or oat bran. Yes, it sounds like an Instagram-worthy breakfast (er, who doesn't love avo toast?) but refrain from scoffing the ingredients for a second, because they'll work much better all over your face. According to Clean Beauty co-founder Dominika Minarovic, honey is an excellent humectant, which means it helps skin retain moisture without feeling oily - but that's not all. 'It's a wonder ingredient,' says Dominika. 'Massaged on to affected areas, it helps with the appearance of scars and increases both healing and tissue regeneration.'</p>
    <h2>Clay Face Mask</h2>
    <p>'The best way to balance dry skin is with the right foods and moisture,' explains Herting. 'This refreshing spring mask will hydrate your skin from within. For calming effects simply add a few drops of lavender essential oil to the mix. Lavender is probably the best known essential oil; its distinctive scent can help relax the nervous system and it is particularly useful for relieving symptoms of restlessness, irritability and insomnia. Mix all of the ingredients together to form a smooth paste, massage gently into your face and neck and leave on for 20 minutes before rinsing off with warm water.

    <h2>Honey Face Mask</h2>
    <p>This face mask is used for soothing and calming skin.To make it you need 1 tsp honey, 1 tsp coconut oil, 1/4 ripe avocado, and 2 drops of lavender oil. Like one big glow in a bowl, this delicious-sounding face mask delivers deep hydration from the coconut oil, gives your skin a hit of antioxidants with the honey and soothes redness with the lavender oil. Mix it up and paint it on with a face mask brush for the ultimate at-home spa experience.</p>
